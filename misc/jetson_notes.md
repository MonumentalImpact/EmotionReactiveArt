[How to set up](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-nano-2gb-devkit#intro)

I tried using the nano. There are apparently problems with 4.6.1 version with these boards. [see forum here](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/jetson-2gb-default-login-and-parol/208893/47)

OK, I got it to boot with v4.6. After I did "apt upgrade" and rebooted, the system locked up.

I will not be pursuing using the jetson nano any more.
